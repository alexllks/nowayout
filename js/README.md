### 2. Verify Installation
- Open a terminal and execute the following command to check if Node.js is installed:
```bash
node --version
```
- If the command displays the installed Node.js version, the installation is successful.

### 3. Open server

```bash
node server.js
```
- If you encounter issues:
  - Ensure that Node.js is properly installed and added to your PATH.
  - Restart your terminal after any installations to update the environment variables.

### 4. Open a browser:
- When the server starts, it will display a message similar to:
   - ``` Server running at http://localhost:3000/ ```
